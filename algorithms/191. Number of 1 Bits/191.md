# [191. Number of 1 Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/description/)

Write a function that takes the binary representation of a positive integer and returns the number of set bits (also known as the [Hamming weight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)).

**Example 1:**

```

<div class="example-block">
Input: n = 11

Output: 3

Explanation:

The input binary string **1011** has a total of three set bits.
```

**Example 2:**

```

<div class="example-block">
Input: n = 128

Output: 1

Explanation:

The input binary string **10000000** has a total of one set bit.
```

**Example 3:**

```
<div class="example-block">
Input: n = 2147483645

Output: 30

Explanation:

The input binary string **1111111111111111111111111111101** has a total of thirty set bits.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1`

**Follow up:** If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?
